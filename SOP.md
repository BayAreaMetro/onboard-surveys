## Procurement and Contracting


MTC will procure consulting resources to carry out the Survey Program, and oversee consultant performance to ensure delivery of high quality data and survey summary products. 













## Survey Procedures, Questions, and Data Collection Methods


An example task order is available [here](https://mtcdrive.box.com/Example-Task-Order)












## Survey Scheduling

The tentative schedule for surveying operators is available [here](http://metropolitantransportationcommission.github.io/onboard-surveys/schedule/).









## Funding Responsbiities of MTC and Operators


As desribed in Attachment B, Appendix B-5 of Resolution 3866 related to transit coordination, available [here](https://mtcdrive.box.com/Resolution-3866-Amendment), both MTC and the operators have respective funding responsbilities. As per the Resolution 3866 amendment, above, MTC will pay 80 percent of the cost to survey service of the top seven operators by ridership, and respective operators will pay a 20-percent share:

1. Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District (AC Transit);
2. Bay Area Rapid Transit District (BART);
3. Caltrain;
4. Golden Gate Bridge, Highway, and Transportation District (Golden Gate Transit); 
5. San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SF Muni); 
6. San Mateo County Transit District (SamTrans); and
7. Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA)

Federally-funded operators not listed below will pay no cost to survey service they provide. MTC recognizes that, in some instances, operators would like to leverage scheduled survey activities to augment additional surveys to those paid for by MTC, or to perform outher related field work with the MTC-procured consultant. MTC will make every reasonable effort to accommodate such requests. Such requests can generally be incorporated into the scheduled work program via the addition of a funding agreement or modification of an existing agreement. 

## Data Distribution Procedures

It is our intention to share all deliverables produced by the Survey Program equally with operators. That is, both operators and MTC own any reporting materials and the raw and processed data arising from data collection. Operators are free to decide how to use these work products and whom to share them - including internal staff, outside consultants, academic researchers, and other interested parties. Because the surveys ask respondents about some personal and household characteristics regarded as personally-identifiable iMTC has worked closely with its General Counsel to develop two non-disclosure agreements (NDA) for the purpose of sharing data: (1) an NDA for data distributed with passenger location information (e.g., passenger home, work, school, etc. locations) geocoded to the discrete point level (latitude, longitude); and (2) an NDA for data distributed with location information geocoded to more aggregate geographies such as census tract, travel analysis zone (TAZ), or something similar. The NDAs MTC uses are available [here](https://mtcdrive.app.box.com/files/0/f/3852966121/Blank_NDAs) for download. Transit operators are encouraged to develop similar instruments for safeguarding shared data, or to include language within their consultant contracts for this purpose.
