## Procurement and Contracting

MTC will procure consulting resources to carry out the Survey Program, and oversee consultant performance to ensure delivery of high quality data and survey summary products. MTC's current contracting environment includes a "bench" of three consultants to spread the work among. All three were selected in a competitive recruitment and all have a lot of experience in transit passenger surveying. The three bench consultants from MTC's more recent procurement are Corey, Canapary, & Galanis of San Francisco, California; ETC Institute of Olathe, Kansas; and, Redhill Group of Irvine, California. 

MTC staff works closely with operator liaisons in all matters related to survey scheduling (see Survey Scheduling, below), contracting, and administration. Work is issued to contractors using MTC-issued task orders, which include work scope, requested deliverables, budget, anticipated schedule, and other relevant items such as disadvantage business enterprise (DBE) subcontracting goals, etc. A recent example executed task order is available [here](https://mtcdrive.box.com/Example-Task-Order)

## Data Collection

It is MTC's goal to collect data from somewhere between 5 and 7.5 percent of passenger boardings. Segmented by time of day. Custom questions from operators.

Types of data collected include:

**1. Location data** 
	a. Trip origin	
	b. First transit boarding 	
	c. Last transit alighting	
	d. Trip destination	
	e. Bus/rail transfer location points	
	f. Home location	
	g. Work location (if appropriate)	
	h. School location (if appropriate)
	
**2. Access/egress modes** 
	a. Access mode from trip origin to first transit boarding	
	b. Egress mode from last transit alighting to trip destination
	
**3. Type of trip taken**
	a. Origin type (e.g., home, work, shopping, etc.)	
	b. Destination type (same types as origin)
	
**4. Time leaving home in the A.M. and returning home in the P.M.**

**5. Fare payment**
	a. Payment method (e.g., cash, Clipper Card, paper transfer, etc.)	
	b. Payment category (e.g., adult, senior, youth, etc.)
	
**6. Houshould and person demographics**
	a. Race/ethnicity	
	b. Age	
	c. Gender	
	d. Worker status	
	e. Student status	
	f. Ability to speak English	
	g. Language spoken in home other than English	
	h. Number of persons in household	
	i. Number of workers in household	
	j. Number of household working vehicles	
	k. Household income
	
**7. Custom questions by operators. Examples include:.**
	a. Frequency of riding the transit operator.
	b. Means of getting schedule information (paper schedules, internet site, etc.)
	c. Overall satisfaction with service

## Survey Scheduling

It is anticipated that it will take approximately five years to survey all TDA-claiming operators within the Bay Area. In order to achieve "representativeness" of passenger selection for sampling, the surveys will be conducted in fall and spring seasons, when ridership is presumed to be less impacted by vacations, holidays, and tourism. In terms of scheduling operator surveys by year and season, this will be done in cooperation with the steering group and with individual operators. Variables to consider in developing the schedule include: 

1. Timing related to capital projects, such as new light rail construction
2. Timing related to federal requirements, such as Title VI reporting
3. Changes to vehicle operating schedules
4. Balancing the sampling of larger and smaller operators
5. Clustering sampling of operators by geography to increase efficiency in deploying consultant resources

The tentative schedule for surveying operators is available [here](http://metropolitantransportationcommission.github.io/onboard-surveys/schedule/).

## Survey Funding

As described in Attachment B, Appendix B-5 of Resolution 3866 related to transit coordination, available [here](https://mtcdrive.box.com/Resolution-3866-Amendment), both MTC and the operators have respective funding responsbilities. As per the Resolution 3866 amendment, above, MTC will pay 80 percent of the cost to survey service of the top seven operators by ridership, and respective operators will pay a 20-percent share:

1. Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District (AC Transit)
2. Bay Area Rapid Transit District (BART)
3. Caltrain
4. Golden Gate Bridge, Highway, and Transportation District (Golden Gate Transit)
5. San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SF Muni) 
6. San Mateo County Transit District (SamTrans)
7. Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA)

Federally-funded operators not listed below will pay no cost to survey service they provide. MTC recognizes that, in some instances, operators would like to leverage scheduled survey activities to augment additional surveys to those paid for by MTC, or to perform outher related field work with the MTC-procured consultant. MTC will make every reasonable effort to accommodate such requests. Such requests can generally be incorporated into the scheduled work program via the addition of a funding agreement or modification of an existing agreement. 

## Data Distribution Procedures

All deliverables produced by the Survey Program are shared equally between MTC and operators. Both operators and MTC own any reporting materials and the raw and processed data arising from data collection. Operators are free to decide how to use these work products and with whom to share them - including internal staff, outside consultants, academic researchers, and other interested parties. Because the surveys ask respondents about some personal and household characteristics regarded as personally-identifiable iMTC has worked closely with its General Counsel to develop two non-disclosure agreements (NDA) for the purpose of sharing data: (1) an NDA for data distributed with passenger location information (e.g., passenger home, work, school, etc. locations) geocoded to the discrete point level (latitude, longitude); and (2) an NDA for data distributed with location information geocoded to more aggregate geographies such as census tract, travel analysis zone (TAZ), or something similar. The NDAs MTC uses are available [here](https://mtcdrive.app.box.com/files/0/f/3852966121/Blank_NDAs) for download. Transit operators are encouraged to develop similar instruments for safeguarding shared data, or to include language within their consultant contracts for this purpose.
