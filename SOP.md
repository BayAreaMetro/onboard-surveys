## Procurement and Contracting

MTC will procure consulting resources to carry out the Survey Program, and oversee consultant performance to ensure delivery of high quality data and survey summary products. 

## Survey Procedures, Questions, and Data Collection Methods

## Survey Scheduling

It is anticipated that it will take approximately five years to survey all TDA-claiming operators within the Bay Area. In order to achieve "representativeness" of passenger selection for sampling, the surveys will be conducted in fall and spring seasons, when ridership is presumed to be less impacted by vacations, holidays, and tourism. In terms of scheduling operator surveys by year and season, this will be done in cooperation with the steering group and with individual operators. Variables to consider in developing the schedule include: 

1. Timing related to capital projects, such as new light rail construction
2. Timing related to federal requirements, such as Title VI reporting
3. Changes to vehicle operating schedules
4. Balancing the sampling of larger and smaller operators
5. Clustering sampling of operators by geography to increase efficiency in deploying consultant resources

The tentative schedule for surveying operators is available [here](http://metropolitantransportationcommission.github.io/onboard-surveys/schedule/).

## Funding Responsbiities of MTC and Operators

As described in Attachment B, Appendix B-5 of Resolution 3866 related to transit coordination, available [here](https://mtcdrive.box.com/Resolution-3866-Amendment), both MTC and the operators have respective funding responsbilities. As per the Resolution 3866 amendment, above, MTC will pay 80 percent of the cost to survey service of the top seven operators by ridership, and respective operators will pay a 20-percent share:

1. Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District (AC Transit)
2. Bay Area Rapid Transit District (BART)
3. Caltrain
4. Golden Gate Bridge, Highway, and Transportation District (Golden Gate Transit)
5. San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SF Muni) 
6. San Mateo County Transit District (SamTrans)
7. Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA)

Federally-funded operators not listed below will pay no cost to survey service they provide. MTC recognizes that, in some instances, operators would like to leverage scheduled survey activities to augment additional surveys to those paid for by MTC, or to perform outher related field work with the MTC-procured consultant. MTC will make every reasonable effort to accommodate such requests. Such requests can generally be incorporated into the scheduled work program via the addition of a funding agreement or modification of an existing agreement. 

## Data Distribution Procedures

All deliverables produced by the Survey Program are shared equally between MTC and operators. Both operators and MTC own any reporting materials and the raw and processed data arising from data collection. Operators are free to decide how to use these work products and with whom to share them - including internal staff, outside consultants, academic researchers, and other interested parties. Because the surveys ask respondents about some personal and household characteristics regarded as personally-identifiable iMTC has worked closely with its General Counsel to develop two non-disclosure agreements (NDA) for the purpose of sharing data: (1) an NDA for data distributed with passenger location information (e.g., passenger home, work, school, etc. locations) geocoded to the discrete point level (latitude, longitude); and (2) an NDA for data distributed with location information geocoded to more aggregate geographies such as census tract, travel analysis zone (TAZ), or something similar. The NDAs MTC uses are available [here](https://mtcdrive.app.box.com/files/0/f/3852966121/Blank_NDAs) for download. Transit operators are encouraged to develop similar instruments for safeguarding shared data, or to include language within their consultant contracts for this purpose.
