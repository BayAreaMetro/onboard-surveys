## SOP Goals

The SOPs here describe how Bay Area transit passenger surveys will be administered in cooperation between MTC and operators. Through this process, it is our current goal to cooperatively survey the entire region's Transportation Development Act (TDA) funded fixed-route transit ridership over a five- to seven-year period. Survey goals include supporting operator Title VI reporting requirements; refinement of analytical planning tools, such as MTC's travel demand model; and providing data for regional and operator-specific ridership market and equity analyses. 

## Procurement and Contracting

MTC will procure consulting resources to carry out the Survey Program, and oversee consultant performance to ensure delivery of high quality data and survey summary products. MTC's current contracting environment includes a "bench" of three consultants to spread the work among. All three were selected in a competitive recruitment and all have a lot of experience in transit passenger surveying. The three bench consultants from MTC's most recent procurement are Corey, Canapary, & Galanis of San Francisco, California; ETC Institute of Olathe, Kansas; and, Redhill Group of Irvine, California. 

MTC staff works closely with operator liaisons in all matters related to survey scheduling (see Survey Scheduling, below), contracting, and administration. Work is assigned to contractors via MTC-issued task orders, which include work scope, requested deliverables, budget, anticipated schedule, and other relevant items such as disadvantage business enterprise (DBE) subcontracting goals, etc. A recent example executed task order is available [here](https://mtcdrive.box.com/Example-Task-Order).

## Data Collection

It is MTC's goal to collect data from somewhere between 5 and 7.5 percent of passenger boardings, attempting to strike a balance between survey cost and sample representativeness of transit ridership. Sampling plans are developed to select passengers randomly, spread over the day-long operating hours of transit routes, for both weekday and weekend ridership, as relevant. Survey quota goals are segmented by time-of-day periods for weekday ridership (either MTC's time periods, the time periods used by operators, or custom time periods), and by Saturday and Sunday for weekends. The battery of questions asked passengers has become mostly standardized over the many surveys conducted by MTC. An exception to this is the approximately 3-5 questions that can be added by operators to produce a more customized survey. Example custom questions include customer service-type questions such as frequency of ridership and rider experience on transit vehicles. The types of questions asked in a standard MTC survey are described below, and include:

**1. Geocoded location data** 

	a. Trip origin	
	b. First transit boarding 	
	c. Last transit alighting	
	d. Trip destination	
	e. Bus/rail transfer location points	
	f. Home location	
	g. Work location (if appropriate)	
	h. School location (if appropriate)
	
**2. Access/egress modes** 

	a. Access mode from trip origin to first transit boarding	
	b. Egress mode from last transit alighting to trip destination
	
**3. Type of trip taken**

	a. Origin type (e.g., home, work, shopping, etc.)	
	b. Destination type (same types as origin)
	
**4. Time leaving home in the A.M. and returning home in the P.M.**

**5. Fare payment**

	a. Payment method (e.g., cash, Clipper Card, paper transfer, etc.)	
	b. Payment category (e.g., adult, senior, youth, etc.)
	
**6. Houshould and person demographics**

	a. Hispanic/Latino status
	b. Race	
	c. Age	
	d. Gender	
	e. Worker status	
	f. Student status	
	g. Ability to speak English	
	h. Language spoken at home other than English	
	i. Disability status
	j. Number of persons in household	
	k. Number of workers in household	
	l. Number of household working vehicles	
	m. Household income
	
**7. Custom questions by operators. Examples include:.**

	a. Frequency of riding the transit operator
	b. Means of getting schedule information (paper schedules, internet site, etc.)
	c. Overall satisfaction with service
	
Due to lower response rates and incompleteness of many surveys, MTC has migrated away from the use of paper survey instruments for transit passenger data collection. Instead, MTC has collected passenger data using two different methods. The first method, initially deployed in 2012, involved capturing passenger names and contact phone numbers, and then administering a follow-up computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI). The CATI survey efficiently tailors questions to match the travel patterns and demographic characteristics of each passenger.  More recently, beginning in 2014, MTC has been utilizing the method advocated by the Federal Transit Administration for transit passenger surveys, that of an in-person interview peformed with a tablet computer. The tablet computer approach combines higher response rates with more complete and more accurate surveying. Similar to the CATI approach, the tablet computer aids interviewers in asking questions via a surveying "script," skipping questions that aren't relevant to individual passengers. To help people understand the types of questions asked by MTC, a draft mock-up paper version of the Muni survey (which has also been translated into an in-person tablet computer "script") is available [here](https://mtcdrive.box.com/v/muni-final-survey). The tablet computer "script" of the in-person Napa VINE survey is provided [here](https://mtcdrive.box.com/v/tablet-survey) to understand what is captured in the fully expanded in-person questionnaire. It is important to remember that the tablet computer used by interviewers skips through the survey, so not every question is asked of all passengers. 

It should be noted that, while MTC staff believe that an in-person interview utilizing a tablet computer is currently the best available survey technology, they are open to other methods of data collection and they seek the continual refinement of survey tools.

## Survey Scheduling

It is anticipated that it will take approximately five to seven years to survey all TDA-claiming operators within the Bay Area. In order to achieve "representativeness" of passenger selection for sampling, the surveys will be conducted in fall and spring seasons, when ridership is presumed to be less impacted by vacations, holidays, and tourism. In terms of scheduling operator surveys by year and season, this will be done in cooperation with the steering group and with individual operators. Variables to consider in developing the schedule include: 

1. Timing related to capital projects, such as new light rail construction
2. Timing related to federal requirements, such as Title VI reporting
3. Changes to vehicle operating schedules
4. Balancing the resource and budgetary needs of surveying larger and smaller operators
5. Clustering sampling of operators by geography to increase efficiency in deploying consultant resources

The tentative schedule for surveying operators is available [here](http://metropolitantransportationcommission.github.io/onboard-surveys/schedule/).

## Survey Funding

As described in Attachment B, Appendix B-5 of Resolution 3866 related to transit coordination, available [here](https://mtcdrive.box.com/Resolution-3866-Amendment), both MTC and the operators have respective funding responsbilities. As per the Resolution 3866 amendment, MTC will pay 80 percent of the cost to survey service of the top seven operators by ridership, and respective operators will pay a 20-percent share:

1. Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District (AC Transit)
2. Bay Area Rapid Transit District (BART)
3. Caltrain
4. Golden Gate Bridge, Highway, and Transportation District (Golden Gate Transit)
5. San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SF Muni) 
6. San Mateo County Transit District (SamTrans)
7. Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA)

Federally-funded Bay Area operators not listed above will pay no cost to survey service they provide. MTC recognizes that, in some instances, operators would like to leverage scheduled survey activities to augment additional surveys to those paid for by MTC, or to perform other related field work with the MTC-procured consultant. MTC will make every reasonable effort to accommodate such requests. Such requests can generally be incorporated into the scheduled work program via the addition of a funding agreement or with the modification of an existing agreement. Additional scope of this kind will be added at the operator's expense.  

## Data Sharing

All deliverables produced by the Survey Program are shared equally between MTC and operators. Both operators and MTC own any reporting materials and the raw and processed data arising from data collection. Operators are free to decide how to use these work products and with whom to share them - including internal staff, outside consultants, other governmental entities, academic researchers, and other interested parties. Because the surveys ask respondents about some personal and household characteristics regarded as personally-identifiable information (PII), it is in the interests of both MTC and operators to safeguard these data from general public release. MTC has worked closely with its General Counsel to develop two non-disclosure agreements (NDA) for the purpose of sharing data containing PII: (1) an NDA for data with passenger location information (e.g., passenger home, work, school, etc. locations) geocoded to the discrete point level (latitude, longitude); and (2) an NDA for data with location information geocoded to more aggregate geographies such as census tracts, travel analysis zones (TAZ), or something equivalent or larger in size and/or population.  

Based on Steering Committee member feedback, MTC will obtain permission to share discrete-level (latitude, longitude) data collected for the following operators:

1. SF Muni
2. BART
3. SamTrans
4. Caltrain

The NDAs MTC uses are available [here](https://mtcdrive.app.box.com/v/BlankNDAs) for download. Transit operators are encouraged to develop similar instruments for safeguarding shared data, and/or to include protective language within their consultant contracts for this purpose.
